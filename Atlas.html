    <h2>RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation)</h2>
    <div class="page-body">
        <div class="page-content">
            <p>The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is a widely used model designed to estimate long-term average annual soil loss caused by sheet and rill erosion from rainfall and associated overland flow. It’s especially valuable in land use planning, conservation practices, and watershed management.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">RUSLE Formula:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.3em;">
                <code><em>A = R × K × LS × C × P</em></code></p>

            <ul>
                <li>
  <h3><strong>R FACTOR / Rainfall Erosivity Factor</strong></h3>
  <p>
    The R factor (Rainfall Erosivity Factor) quantifies the impact of raindrop energy and the potential for rainfall to cause soil erosion. 
    It is a crucial component in the RUSLE model as it captures the erosive force of precipitation over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Data typically used:</strong> High-resolution daily or monthly precipitation data from weather stations or satellite products.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Data used in this study:</strong> I used daily rainfall raster data for the year 2024, specifically covering the Machakos region. 
    The data was obtained from the <a href="https://climateserv.servirglobal.net/" target="_blank">ClimateSERV platform</a>, 
    which provides access to satellite-derived climate datasets suitable for environmental modeling and analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Methodology:</strong> The daily rainfall rasters were processed using Python, where I aggregated the precipitation values over the full year 
    to calculate cumulative erosivity. Libraries such as <code>rasterio</code>, <code>numpy</code>, and <code>matplotlib</code> were used to handle data input, computation, and visualization. 
    The final output was a single raster layer representing the spatial distribution of the R factor for 2024.
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Formula applied:</strong> In this study, due to the unavailability of 30-minute interval rainfall data (I<sub>30</sub>), I applied an alternative empirical formula:
    <br><code>R = ∑P<sub>i</sub>²</code>
    <br>Where <em>P<sub>i</sub></em> is the daily rainfall amount in mm. This formula has been widely used in African-based studies as a substitute to calculate rainfall erosivity from daily data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Reason for choosing this formula:</strong> The original RUSLE requires high-frequency rainfall data to compute rainfall intensity and kinetic energy, which was unavailable for this study area. 
    Therefore, I adopted this empirical approach, which uses daily data to estimate the erosive potential more feasibly and spatially.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Alternative method (Kasam scenario):</strong> Another alternative commonly used is the Kasam approach, where monthly rainfall is interpolated using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) in QGIS 
    and then multiplied by an empirical constant to estimate erosivity. However, I focused on the daily raster approach in Python to maintain spatial resolution and accuracy.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Comparison with KMD map:</strong> To validate the generated 2024 R-factor map, I compared it with the annual erosivity map from the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD). 
    Although KMD uses station-based data and potentially different methodology, the spatial patterns showed notable similarities in erosive zones, especially in areas with high annual rainfall.

    <h2>Comparative Topographic Analysis of Mount Kenya Ascent Routes : why there is no established climbing route via ragati near Karatina University</h2>
    <div class="page-body">
        <div class="page-content">
            <p>The topographic map of the Mount Kenya region, created using QGIS and DEM data, compares four key ascent approaches: Chogoria, Naro Moru, Sirimon, and Ragati (near Karatina University). The aim is to understand why no formal climbing route exists via Ragati, despite its proximity to the mountain and academic institutions like Karatina University.</p>

            <p>The map highlights elevation contours, straight-line distances, and slope intensity using QGIS-based terrain analysis. Routes were digitized and measured in Google Earth Pro, with slope derived from digital elevation models (DEMs).</p>

                <p><strong>Key findings include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Steep terrain near Ragati:</strong> Tight contour spacing indicates steep ascents, especially in the upper elevations near the summit zone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Longer route length:</strong> The straight-line distance from Ragati to the summit is around 30 km, compared to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chogoria Gate – 15.1 km</li>
                            <li>Naro Moru Gate – 18 km</li>
                            <li>Sirimon Gate – 18.6 km</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Absence of infrastructure:</strong> Unlike the established routes, Ragati lacks ranger stations, foot trails, and support camps, making the area less viable for recreational or guided hiking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental and logistical challenges:</strong> Ragati’s terrain is densely forested and ecologically sensitive, presenting obstacles for route development and conservation management.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This analysis demonstrates that viable hiking routes depend not only on elevation, but also on distance, slope conditions, infrastructure, and environmental feasibility. Despite being geographically closer to Karatina University, Ragati remains an impractical entry point to Mount Kenya’s summit due to topographic and ecological limitations.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High concentration around Lake Victoria:</strong> Western Kenya shows a dense cluster of irrigation schemes, likely due to proximity to Lake Victoria, high rainfall, and fertile soils.</li>
                    <li><strong>Significant presence around Mount Kenya:</strong> The central highlands near Mount Kenya also host many schemes, supported by mountain-fed rivers and productive volcanic soils.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong alignment along major rivers:</strong> A notable linear pattern of irrigation schemes follows River Tana, especially in the areas  of Bura, indicating dependency on permanent water sources for irrigation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sparse distribution in arid regions:</strong> Northern and northeastern Kenya have noticeably fewer irrigation points, suggesting limitations due to aridity and lack of reliable water sources.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The map includes a locator inset, north arrow, and scale bar for geographic reference. It was developed using CSV point data and base maps such as OpenStreetMap and elevation raster. The insights derived help to understand water dependency, spatial planning, and agricultural infrastructure distribution across Kenya.</p>

                            <p>This geological map of Kenya, created using QGIS, visually represents the country’s diverse geological formations. The map categorizes Kenya’s geology into distinct units, each marked by a unique color and label in the legend. These units correspond to different rock types and geological periods, ranging from Precambrian (PC, pCm) to Quaternary (Qe, Qp, QT, Qv) rocks, as well as Jurassic (J, JC, JT, JTr), Cretaceous (K), Miocene (Mi), and Tertiary (T, Ti, TrP) formations. The map also includes water bodies (H2O) and sea areas (SEA).</p>

                                    <li><strong>Precambrian Rocks (PC, pCm):</strong> Predominantly in the western and central regions, indicating ancient basement rocks.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Quaternary Deposits (Qe, Qp, QT, Qv):</strong> Scattered across the country, often associated with volcanic activity and recent sedimentation, especially in the Rift Valley.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Jurassic and Cretaceous formations (J, JC, JT, JTr, K):</strong> Found in the eastern and coastal regions, reflecting sedimentary deposits from those periods.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks (T, Ti, TrP, Mi):</strong> Prominent along the central Rift Valley and parts of northern Kenya, associated with volcanic activity and rifting during the Tertiary period.</li>
